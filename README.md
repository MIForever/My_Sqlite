# Welcome to My Sqlite
***

## Task
The task is to create the MySqliteRequest class and the command line input version it,
so that users perform various actions on CSV files.

## Description
We used regular expressions to make the task easier and shorten the code. It also improves code efficiency.
This is an example of a mini version of Sqlite to be an example for users on Ruby.

## Installation
You just install it and write your own requests to the my_sqlite_request.rb file or
type your command through my_sqlite_cli.rb script

## Usage
Once you have written your to the class requests type to the command line:
```
ruby my_sqlite_request.rb
```

Or to use the command line input version of it:
```
ruby my_sqlite_cli.rb
```
